# Introduction

Like the BlueBikes system on the Boston and Cambridge, New York City also has a bikes-for-rent service to help its citizens navigate within and around the city. The infrastructure is sponsored by Citi bank, and thus their service is named Citibikes.

The service produces a lot of valuable data about how the citizens move around. Specifically, the origin, destination, time of day, and ride duration are all quite valuable. Citibikes publically provides this information at https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data. 

# Questions

I had a couple of questions that I wanted to answer with the dataset:

* Where did people go in the city with the Citibikes?
* What trends could be found based on how people traveled on Citibikes?
*
